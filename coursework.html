    <h2 class= "w3-text-black">Spring 2022</h2>


    <p><span class="w3-large w3-text-black w3-margin-right">Exploratory Text Analytics</span></p>
    <p>Introduction to text analytics with a focus on long-form documents, such as reviews, news articles, 
      and novels. Students convert source texts into structure-preserving analytical form and then apply information theory,
       NLP tools, and vector-based methods to explore language models, topic models, sentiment analyses, and narrative 
       structures. The focus is on unsupervised methods to explore cognitive and social patterns in texts.</p> 

    <p><span class="w3-large w3-text-black w3-margin-right">Deep Learning</span></p>
    <p>This course will focus on Spark, an open-source, general-purpose computing framework that is scalable & fast. 
      Fundamental data types & concepts are covered. You will learn how to use Spark for large-scale analytics & 
       machine learning, among other topics. Tools for data storage and retrieval are covered, including AWS.</p>

    <p><span class="w3-large w3-text-black w3-margin-right">Big Data Systems</span></p>
    <p>A graduate-level course on deep learning fundamentals and applications with emphasis on their broad 
      applicability to problems across a range of disciplines. Topics include regularization, optimization, 
      convolutional networks, sequence modeling, generative learning, instance-based learning, and deep reinforcement 
      learning.</p>

    <p><span class="w3-large w3-text-black w3-margin-right">Data Visualization (Audit) </span></p>
    <p>Thinking with Images. People have been looking at data for centuries -- with their eyes -- to discover patterns,
       meaning, and insight into the most important challenges of their time. This course teaches visual and spatial thinking
        coupled with visual data tools and interactive web coding to envision information. Far beyond plotting, finding ways 
        to respond to complex problems, we will study and make useful, compelling, and beautiful tools to see.</p>

    <h2 class= "w3-text-black">Fall 2021</h2>

    <p><span class="w3-large w3-text-black w3-margin-right">Foundations of Computer Science</span></p>
    <p>Provide a foundation in discrete mathematics, data structures, algorithmic design and implementation,
       computational complexity, parallel computing, and data integrity and consistency for non-CS, non-CpE students.
        Case studies and exercises will be drawn from real-world examples (e.g., bioinformatics, public health, marketing,
         and security).</p>

    <p><span class="w3-large w3-text-black w3-margin-right">Ethics of Big Data</span></p>
    <p>This course examines the ethical issues arising around big data and provides frameworks, context, concepts, and 
      theories to help students think through and deal with the issues as they encounter them in their professional lives.</p>

    <p><span class="w3-large w3-text-black w3-margin-right">Statistical Learning</span></p>
    <p>This course covers fundamentals of data mining and machine learning within a common statistical framework. 
      Topics include regression, classification, clustering, resampling, regularization, tree-based methods, ensembles,
       boosting, and Support Vector Machines.</p>

    <p><span class="w3-large w3-text-black w3-margin-right">Bayesian Machine Learning</span></p>
    <p>Bayesian inferential methods provide a foundation for machine learning under conditions of uncertainty. 
      Bayesian machine learning techniques can help us to more effectively address the limits to our understanding of 
      world problems. This class covers the major related techniques, including Bayesian inference, conjugate prior 
      probabilities, naive Bayes classifiers, expectation maximization, Markov chain monte carlo, and variational inference.</p>

    <h2 class= "w3-text-black">Summer 2021</h2>


    <p><span class="w3-large w3-text-black w3-margin-right">Linear Models for Data Science</span></p>
    <p>An introduction to linear statistical models in the context of data science. Topics include simple and multiple 
      linear regression, generalized linear models, time series, analysis of covariance, tree-based classification, and
       principal components.</p>
   
    <p><span class="w3-large w3-text-black w3-margin-right">Programming for Data Science</span></p>
    <p>An introduction to essential programming concepts, structures, and techniques. Students will gain confidence 
      in not only reading code, but learning what it means to write good quality code. Additionally, essential and 
      complementary topics are taught, such as testing and debugging, exception handling, and an introduction to visualization.</p>
    
    <p><span class="w3-large w3-text-black w3-margin-right">Practice and Applications of Data Science</span></p>
    <p>An introduction to essential programming concepts, structures, and techniques. Students will gain confidence in not only 
      reading code, but learning what it means to write good quality code. Additionally, essential and complementary topics are 
      taught, such as testing and debugging, exception handling, and an introduction to visualization. This course is project based,
       consisting of a semester project and final project presentations.</p>
